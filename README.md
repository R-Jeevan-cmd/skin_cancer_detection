# 🩺 Skin Cancer Detection – Deep Learning Based Web Application

A simple and effective **skin cancer / skin lesion classification web app** built using **Flask + Deep Learning (CNN)**.  
Users can upload a skin-lesion image, and the model predicts the lesion type based on the **HAM10000** dataset.

This project is for **research & educational purposes only** and is **not a medical diagnostic tool**.

## 🚀 Features

- Image upload interface using **Flask Web App**
- Deep-learning based classifier using **TensorFlow / Keras**
- Preprocessed HAM10000 dataset
- Modular code structure for:
  - Data splitting
  - Model training
  - Federated simulation (optional)
  - ResNet50-based model (optional)
- Easy to run locally
